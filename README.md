Analysing the impact of weather on self-reported happiness across the UK.                 
University of Edinburgh, School of Informatics 

• Used MongoDB to aggregate weather data and happiness-survey data in order to analyze correlations between 
different weather attributes and reported happiness levels across the UK. 
• Performed clustering on weather data using KMeans to group weather stations with similar weather patterns, 
making use of Python’s Scikit-learn library. Trained and evaluated a Gaussian Naïve Baye’s classifier to predict the 
general location of a weather station based on the weather data recorded at the station.
